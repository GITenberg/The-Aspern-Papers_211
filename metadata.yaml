description: The Aspern Papers is a novella set in Venice. A young man travels to
  the city and takes lodgings with an old woman--the former lover of the dead American
  poet Aspern. The man believes the old woman still has some letters from Aspern and
  he ingratiates himself with her niece in an attempt to find them. Suspense builds
  around the motives and actions of James' masterfully drawn characters.
